# Intent Router

Route user request → correct skill in <5 seconds. Bypass heavy deliberation for obvious cases.

## Routing rules

### Direct action (no skill invocation)

| User says | Action |
|---|---|
| "fix typo in X" | Direct edit, skip all skills |
| "what does X do?" | Read file, summarize — no workflow |
| "show me Y" | Show content — no workflow |
| "rename X to Y" | Direct refactor via search + replace |
| "delete unused Z" | Direct delete after confirmation |
| Question with known answer | Direct answer |

### Single-skill routing

| User intent | Route to |
|---|---|
| "help me think about X" / "trade-offs of X" | `nc-brainstorm` |
| "research X library" | `nc-research` |
| "plan how to build X" | `nc-plan` |
| "fix this bug: <description>" | `nc-debug` → `nc-fix` |
| "implement X feature" | `nc-cook` |
| "is this approach safe?" | `nc-predict` |
| "audit security" | `nc-security` |
| "what could go wrong?" | `nc-scenario` |
| "write tests for X" | `nc-test` |
| "deploy this" | `nc-deploy-vps` (if NextCore VPS) or ask host |
| "add DB schema for X" | `nc-databases` |
| "design the UI for X" | `nc-ui-ux-pro-max` → `nc-frontend-development` |

### Multi-skill pipelines

| User intent | Pipeline |
|---|---|
| "build a new feature X" | `nc-brainstorm` → `nc-plan` → `nc-cook` → `nc-test` |
| "production bug in X" | `nc-debug` → `nc-fix` → `nc-test` → deploy |
| "weekly review" | `nc-retro` → `nc-journal` |
| "session ending, save state" | `nc-journal` → `nc-watzup` |

## Decision signals

### Signals for LIGHT routing (direct action, no skill)

- Request under 10 words
- Specific file + specific change mentioned
- User is in flow mode ("quickly fix...")
- Agent has full context already

### Signals for HEAVY routing (pipeline)

- Request uses words like "design", "architect", "plan"
- Scope unclear
- Multiple unknowns
- User is exploring options

### Signals for AMBIGUOUS (ask 1 question)

- Request spans multiple domains (UI + backend + DB)
- "Let's build a platform/system/product" (too large)
- "Fix the performance" (which area?)

**Ask maximum 1 clarifying question**, then route decisively.

## Anti-patterns

- **Invoking nc-brainstorm for "rename this variable"** — massive overhead waste
- **Pipeline for "show me X"** — single tool call suffices
- **Routing to multiple skills in parallel when serial pipeline expected** — corrupts handoff
- **Endless clarification loop** — after 1 question, commit to route

## Short-circuits

If session already has a plan (`plans/{YYMMDD}.../plan.md` exists and is active):
- Skip `nc-brainstorm` and `nc-plan`
- Route new requests to `nc-cook` with plan context
- Only re-plan if user explicitly says "replan"

If debugging session active (`plans/reports/debug-*.md` exists recent):
- Skip re-debug
- Route to `nc-fix` with debug context

## Lead-in phrases to listen for

- "help me think" → brainstorm
- "I want to understand" → research / scout
- "I don't know how to" → plan or brainstorm
- "this is broken" → debug
- "make it work" → fix (after debug)
- "ship it" → deploy

## Integration

- `nc-context-budget` — router checks budget, short-circuits when tight
- `nc-skill-composition` — router hands off to pipeline
- `nc-response-format` — router's own response is concise (no over-explanation of routing choice)
